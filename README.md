- 👋 Hi, I’m @RSGerrish or Robin Gerrish
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in programming in general. When I was about 14 years old I stumbled on VB3 and discovered the world of programming AOL 'punters' and 'proggies'. I truly enjoyed making them and I was lucky enough to also go to a High School that had a computer science program in the late 90's. Unfortunately I did not major in programming after high school and I have been regretting it since. While my passion for the subject does have an ebb and flow, it never died over the course of the past 20 years. I've dabbled in all sorts of languages from javascript to c++ but have now settled on full stack development as I need to buckle down on a focus to begin my long delayed career. I also enjoy gardening, taking small adventures with my dog and riding my jet ski on the nearby lake.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full stack development through The Odin Project. I know this will definitely include HTML, CSS and Javascript all of which are reviews for me. If The Odin Project does not also include it, I plan on learning PHP and reviewing SQL so I can begin creating pages that manage databases allowing my sites to provide a persistent experience. This seems to be the area I always struggled to connect the dots with but I am excited to tackle this hurdle shortly!
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that will help me to become a better programmer. I currently plan on spending quite a bit of time working through The Odin Project but assume I will reach out for more collaborative work once I feel I have a strong grasp on full stack development.
