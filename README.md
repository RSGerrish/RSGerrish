- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RSGerrish or Robin Gerrish

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming in general. When I was about 14 years old I stumbled on VB3 and discovered the world of programming AOL 'punters' and 'proggies'. I truly enjoyed making them and I was lucky enough to also go to a High School that had a computer science program in the late 90's. Unfortunately I did not major in programming after high school and I have been regretting it since. While my passion for the subject does have an ebb and flow, it never died over the course of the past 20 years. I've dabbled in all sorts of languages from javascript to c++ but have now settled on full stack development as I need to buckle down on a focus to begin my long delayed career. I also enjoy gardening, taking small adventures with my dogs and riding my jet ski on the nearby lake.
