- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RSGerrish or Robin Gerrish

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming in general. When I was about 14 years old I stumbled on VB3 and discovered the world of programming AOL 'punters' and 'proggies'. I truly enjoyed making them and I was lucky enough to also go to a High School that had a computer science program in the late 90's. Unfortunately I did not major in programming after high school and I have been regretting it since. While my passion for the subject does have an ebb and flow, it never died over the course of the past 20 years. I've worked in a number of different languages over the years but have now settled on full stack web development focusing in the MERN stack and developing on the NextJS framework.
